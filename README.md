# Interactive-Sorting-ans-Searching-System-Using-Binary-Search-Trees
# Project Summary:
An interactive system for data sorting and searching was developed using Balanced Binary Search
Trees (AVL Trees). The system features an interactive graphical interface created using the
OpenGL library, allowing users to add nodes, search for them, and delete them visually. The system
was designed to be user-friendly while maintaining efficient tree operations.
# Project Structure:
- CMakeLists.txt: CMake configuration file for building the project and linking it with OpenGL
  and GLUT libraries.
- CreatATree.c: Contains the core functions for managing the balanced binary search tree
  (AVL Tree).
- main.c: Contains the main functions for creating the graphical interface and handling input.
- Trees.h: Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes used in tree
  management.
# Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: C
- Libraries: OpenGL, GLUT
- Build Tools: CMake
